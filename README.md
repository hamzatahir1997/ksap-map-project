<h2>Hotspot Mapping Project</h2>

<p>The Hotspot Mapping Project helps us understand how safe students feel in their school. It uses a mix of questions and a map to get a clear picture of safe and unsafe spots in the school. This is very useful for school leaders because they can see where problems might be and try to fix them.</p>

<h3>Here's how it works:</h3>

<h4>Filling Out a Form:</h4>
<p>Students answer some questions about themselves, like their grade and some personal stuff. This helps us see if different types of students feel differently about safety.</p>

<h4>Coloring the School Map:</h4>
<p>After answering the questions, students get a map of their school. They color the map:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Red</strong> if they feel unsafe in a place.</li>
  <li><strong>Green</strong> if they feel safe.</li>
  <li><strong>Yellow</strong> if they're not sure.</li>
  <li><strong>Grey</strong> for places they don't go to or don't have an opinion about.</li>
</ul>

<h4>For the School Administration:</h4>
<p>There's a special dashboard where all the student answers and map colors are shown. This helps the school leaders see where the problems are. They can also use filters to look at specific things. This dashboard helps them make decisions to make the school a safer place for everyone.</p>
